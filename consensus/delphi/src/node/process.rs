/*
    Approximate Consensus proceeds in rounds. Every round has a state of its own.
    Every round is composed of three stages: a) n-parallel reliable broadcast, b) Witness technique,
    and c) Value reduction. The three stages form a round for Approximate Agreement. 

    The RoundState object is designed to handle all three stages. For the reliable broadcast stage, all n nodes
    initiate a reliable broadcast to broadcast their current round values. This stage of the protocol ends 
    when n-f reliable broadcasts are terminated. 

    In the witness technique stage, every node broadcasts the first n-f nodes whose values are reliably accepted 
    by the current node. We call node $i$ a witness to node $j$ if j reliably accepted the first n-f messages 
    reliably accepted by node $i$. Every node stays in this stage until it accepts n-f witnesses. 

    After accepting n-f witnesses, the node updates its value for the next round and repeats the process for 
    a future round.
